## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS variables
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [SASS](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I learned how to use better global states and preserve their values between renders.


### Continued development

I want to continue exploring real challenges where I get out of my comfort zone like this one, where I had to learn a lot. So I intend to continue focusing deeper and deeper on javascript libraries/frameworks.
